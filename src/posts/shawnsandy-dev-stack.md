When you work in a corporate environment, you become comfortable; you fall into a safe routine work, home, and back to work. There's very little time for anything else; you lose your edge, the dream clouds the mission and the things you were once passionate about now take a backseat and slowly fade away.

At least that's how it felt for me. So I made a decision, dust off some of those projects that I had forgotten about, catch up on all the new shiny stuff that I had missed (a lot of those), create something new and meaningful, and have fun doing it.
