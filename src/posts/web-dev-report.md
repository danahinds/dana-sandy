I'm getting closer to an official launch shawnsandy.dev (no exact launch date), but "I can feel it in my bones" it's getting closer. Most of the development work is done, I'm still tweaking things here and there, adding a couple of nice to have features, refining styles, but everything works. I'm also really pleased with the look and feel of the site. It's simple yet well put together the code and UX flows well.

Before launch, I wanted to measure how the design and development decisions made while building the site would impact performance, accessibility, page load, SEO, etc. So practice what you preach, Shawn!

Google's lighthouse (www.web.dev) web app returned a pretty good scoreâ€”performance and accessibility both got 98 scores. Best practice and SEO got a 100 apiece. There were a couple of minor errors, check below for info and fixes.
